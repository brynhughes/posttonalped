title: Aural Skills and Post-Tonal Music Theory
---

Time spent cultivating aural skills in a post-tonal music theory class can sometimes come at the expense of students' exposure to a greater variety and complexity of repertoire and analytical methodologies. Consider the role of aural skills in your post-tonal music theory pedagogy, and discuss the following questions:

- What aural skills do we expect our students to develop while studying post-tonal music? 
- What role does rhythm play?
- Does time spent on aural skills development warrant less exposure to a variety of repertoire or analytical methods, or vice versa?
- To what extent should students be able to hear and/or perform their analyses?
