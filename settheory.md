## The Importance of Pitch-Class Set Theory in Today's Theory Class

Pitch-class set theory has had an unquestionable impact on our discipline's history, and in turn, a significant influence on undergraduate music theory curricula for many years. Nevertheless, as we consider the growing body of repertoire that might be included in a post-tonal music course, class time becomes increasingly precious. 

Consider the following questions while discussing the importance of pitch-class set theory in today's curricula:

- How much time should be spent on this methodology and the repertories that respond well to it? 
- What do we want our students to learn about related compositional approaches, such as serialism?
