## Tonal Music in the Undergraduate Post-Tonal Theory Curriculum

As we consider what topics we should cover in the “fourth semester” of the undergraduate theory curriculum, the issues of how much (and what) tonal music we should include arise. To focus a discussion of these issues, let us consider the following questions:

- What methodologies (aside from pitch-class set theory) should we be teaching undergraduate students?
- What pieces do we consider “canonic” when we think of tonality in the twentieth (and twenty-first) century?
- What nineteenth century composers and works are also part of this canon?
- How well does the “canonic” repertoire respond to established methodologies?
- What role should popular tonal music play in the fourth semester of undergraduate theory? 
- What role do modes and collections play?
- Other thoughts?
- Does the current curriculum engage all the pieces, composers, and topics of tonal music that we think it should? If not, what do we need to do to make room for it?
