<p>Pitch-class set theory has had an unquestionable impact on our discipline’s history, and in turn, a significant influence on undergraduate music theory curricula for many years. Nevertheless, as we consider the growing body of repertoire that might be included in a post-tonal music course, class time becomes increasingly precious. </p>

<p>Consider the following questions while discussing the importance of pitch-class set theory in today’s curricula:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much time should be spent on this methodology and the repertories that respond well to it? </li>
  <li>What do we want our students to learn about related compositional approaches, such as serialism?</li>
</ul>

<p>Take notes in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZhR0aWyN1J0oCebHJaCgHmB_DQd6Muk0PUS1_KE2LQ/edit?usp=sharing">this Google Doc</a> so that the rest of the group can benefit from your discussion when we reconvene. </p>
