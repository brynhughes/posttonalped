title: Rethinking the Pedagogy of Post-Tonal Music
---

## Abstract

How do our post-tonal classes reflect the repertoire and skills that our students engage
with most when performing post-tonal music? To what degree should our classes be a corrective
for our students’ lack of knowledge about and experience with important post-tonal works they
are unlikely to perform? As we grapple with these and other questions, we propose a special
session to engage three critical topics in the pedagogy of post-tonal music. First, how important
is pitch-class set theory today? How much time should be spent on this methodology and the
repertories that respond well to it? What do we want our students to learn about related
compositional approaches, such as serialism? Second, what role should tonal music play in our
courses? How do we define tonality after 1900? Does this include popular musics? Debussy?
jazz? Copland? Pärt? Higdon? Finally, what aural skills do we expect our students to develop
while studying post-tonal music? What role does rhythm play?
Since these are topics that everyone has experience with, and since all MTSE members
have valuable opinions to contribute to a discussion of them, we seek a format that will
encourage broad participation. Rather than convene a panel discussion, we have chosen three
members of MTSE to serve as “discussion facilitators.” Each facilitator will lead a discussion of
approximately one-third of the membership on their designated topic. Attendees will not be
expected to prepare material in advance of the conference; they will simply be asked to join one
of the discussions.
